# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props stands for properties. What it does in react is that it passes information from one component to another.

  Researched answer: Since React is component based there needs to be communication between components. That is where props helps, it is used as a way to pass information and methods between components and it gives us the ability to pass data to nested components.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event happens whenever the user interacts with the web page. For example, if there is a game of tic tac toe a DOM event happens every time we click on the little box and it returns an x or an o. Or when the user types their email, or when they hover on a name and it changes color. 

  Researched answer: Web applications need to be able to interact with users. When the user clicks, hovers over elements and type. DOM waits to get the interaction and runs the change. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: It means it focuses mainly on classes and objects, like Ruby. I am not completely sure of what functional programming is. But looking at the name I believe it focuses on functions rather than objects. 

  Researched answer: Functional programming relies on fucntions, object-oriented programming is based on classes and respective objects. 




4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is not a whole number, a decimal number 10.4 .An integer is a whole number like 13. 

  Researched answer: In Ruby an integer is a whole number and it can be negative number. A float is a number followed by a decimal point



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: So I was not exactly sure of what this one meant. After googling implicit I got "implied though not plainly expressed. It is obviously a difference between Ruby and JavaScript, right now all I can think about is that maybe there is no need for parenthesis and at some points curly brakets or the arrow. 

  Researched answer: So what it means is that in Ruby the value of the last line of a method is automatically returnes without having to have a return in there. It is not expressed and not necessary.
